## IRIS
## PERSONALISED AI ASSISTANT


Why IRIS?
The word IRIS is a part of human eye which is responsible for vision. 
So Iris picks up all the important expressions from a face which helps analyse the persons condition. 
IRIS is an AI personal assistant designed as a companion with whom a person can share their emotions and feelings with.
IRIS can reply with an appropriate response to help a person cope with their situation better.  
It can also analyse facial cues and detect emotions from an individual and provide meaningful recommendations.
Like if a person appears angry or frustrated, IRIS will reply with a response that will help them calm down or deal with the frustration. 

IRIS uses a deep learning model to identify the emotion of a person.
It takes the dominant emotion on the persons face over a  certain amount of time and replies with an appropriate response for what it thinks the person is feeling.
For example, when a persons face is scanned if the majority of the emotion detected is sad, then IRIS will take that emotion as input and reply with a response to help the individual tackle that particular sentiment.
